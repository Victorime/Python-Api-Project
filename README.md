# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

# Background
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."

But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

# Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called python-api-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: WeatherPy.

Inside the folder that you just created, add new files called WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

Push the above changes to GitHub.
